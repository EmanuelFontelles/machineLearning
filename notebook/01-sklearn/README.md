# Scikit-learn Tutorial

This repository contains notebooks and other files associated with
[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) tutorial from [***Jake VanderPlas***](http://github.com/jakevdp). This repository is a compilations from differents tutorials from [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org).

## Notebooks

The following links are to notebooks containing the tutorial materials.
Note that many of these require files that are in the directory structure of the [github repository](http://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial) in which they are contained.
There is not time during the tutorial to cover all of this material, but I left it in in case attendees would like to go deeper on their own.
