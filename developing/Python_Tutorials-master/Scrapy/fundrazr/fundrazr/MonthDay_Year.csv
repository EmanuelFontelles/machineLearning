"Amazing parents Andrew and Sarah are raising funds to help their
  beautiful twin boys Freddie and Louie, and other children suffering
  from the rare, degenerative condition, CLN5 Batten disease. Freddie and Louie Dawkins are the only known twins in the world with
  this rare form of a rare disease. Born perfectly healthy in 2005, they
  became autistic, blind and recently developed epilepsy. When they were
  diagnosed in 2009, doctors said that without major advancements in
  medical science, there was no hope, no treatment and no cure. In February 2014 Andrew and Sarah decided to fight back through
  ‘Battle Batten’ their very own campaign to exclusively raise money for
  research into CLN5 Batten disease. Originally aiming for just £1,000, they have so far raised an
  incredible £80,000 and unbelievably commissioned two research
  projects. They are the first UK family to privately commission
  research into CLN5 Batten disease; donating funds to the Batten
  Disease Family Association (BDFA), a charity who is managing the
  projects on the family’s behalf. The cash raised in just 12 months has been unexpected, and
  emotionally overwhelming for the family and still, the momentum and
  passion is strong. The family will continue to fundraise for as long
  as they can. Proceeds will be donated to research projects and will
  buy equipment that best offers hope to children with CLN5, including
  Freddie and Louie.",215,of £100k goal,https://fundrazr.com/611LCf,Battle Batten with us,13,,Pound Sterling
"On Sunday, September 24th Team Ride to Give and Team Boom will be participating in Ironman 70.3 Augusta in Augusta , GA (Athlete list with race numbers to follow) Erik and Patty Heine of Oklahoma City, OK were excited to welcome
  their first child, a son Stephen, in 2007. After he was born, the
  Heines observed Stephen had broad thumbs and toes, which they found
  odd but endearing. He also had a LOT of hair! From birth, Stephen
  struggled with feeding which caused him to have trouble gaining
  weight. It was frustrating, but they chalked it up to reflux and enjoy
  their sweet new baby. As he grew, Stephen hit his milestones on time, but always at the
  late end of the ""normal"" range. When Stephen was nine months
  old, he had hernia surgery, which led to the discovery of a heart
  murmur and a kidney abnormality. Following surgery, Stephen's physical
  development stalled, and at one year old, he was referred for Early
  Intervention for therapies. There were still lingering
    questions about his health issues, and after additional testing,
    Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome in
    May of 2008. Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome , a
  genetic disorder which affects approximately 1:250,000 births, is
  characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual
  disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first
  toes. Additional features of the disorder can include eye
  abnormalities, heart and kidney defects, dental problems, and obesity.
  These signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals. People with
  this condition have an increased risk of developing noncancerous and
  cancerous tumors, including certain kinds of brain tumors. Cancer of
  blood-forming tissue (leukemia) also occurs more frequently in people
  with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Infants born with this severe form of
  the disorder usually survive only into early childhood. Thankfully Stephen’s overall health has balanced out, and he
    is a happy and thriving 4th grader. Currently, Stephen receives private physical and occupational
  therapies, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy in
  his school setting.  To meet his goals of independence as an adult,
  Stephen spends approximately 3/4 of his school day with his typically
  developing peers, in the regular education classroom. Also, he has
  difficulty communicating verbally, so he uses Proloquo2Go software on an iPad
  mini to communicate. Doctors have not given the Heines a timeline as to what they should
  expect with Stephen, so they take everything one day at a time.
  They're determined to not let their child's disability or illness keep
  them from doing the things they love and find a way to adapt and make
  that activity possible. Erik is an avid runner, and for years it has
  been an activity he can share with Stephen. Up until recently, they
  have been able to use a traditional running stroller which Stephen has
  now out grown and is not 100% safe for him. After much research, Eric
  found the Blade at www.hoytrunningchairs.com . Hoyt Running Chairs designs and
    manufactures state-of-the-art racing chairs for individuals with
    disabilities. As a subdivision of Southbridge Tool &
    Manufacturing , they are able to custom build each chair to the
    comfort and needs of both the rider and the runner. They pride
    themselves on getting to know their clients and providing them with
    the ultimate racing experience. Mike Didonato , the president of Southbridge
    Tool & Manufacturing first heard the story of Rick and Dick Hoyt in 2009. Dick Hoyt has pushed his son Rick,
      who was diagnosed a spastic quadriplegic with cerebral palsy after
      his birth in 1962, in over 1,000 races including marathons,
      triathlons, and 6 Ironman races. Their story inspired Mike,
    and a few months later he happened to meet Dick Hoyt at a local
    grocery store. Mike mentioned his family’s manufacturing company and
    offered to fix Rick’s chair if needed. The next year, Dick Hoyt
    showed up at Southbridge Tool and Manufacturing and asked if a brand
    new chair could be built for Rick because he was very uncomfortable
    in his original chair. The Signature was built in time for the Hoyts to compete in the 2010 Boston Marathon . The chair was
    beautifully built for comfort, speed, and maneuverability. Soon,
    other teams and families began asking for a chair. In 2014, Mike was
    approached by Nick Sotar , a retired bicycle shop owner, who
    admired The Signature but had some ideas to improve the design. Nick
    presented Mike with a design for a revolutionary new racing chair
    called The Blade , which is easily
    disassembled and can be shipped in a bike box. After Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome at 18
  months old, it took almost seven years before they were able to get
  him on non-income-based Medicaid. As a result, the Heines ate through
  their entire family savings paying for medical bills and therapies
  even with insurance. Unfortunately, the cost of a Blade racing
    wheelchair is approximately 10% of Erik’s gross annual
  salary as a Professor of Music at Oklahoma City University ,
  and not something they have sitting around or in a savings account.
  The Blade has not been deemed ""essential"" by their
  insurance. However, Stephen's Occupational and Physical Therapists
  both believe that a chair that he can use for over a decade IS
  essential to helping him relieve stress and participate in an outdoor
  activity like his typically-developing peers. Ride to Give agrees and wants to provide Stephen with a custom
    built Blade that will fit him perfectly and will be used for years
    to come. Our mission at RTG is to turn athletic ability into
  fundraising power for families with children who are disabled,
  injured, or ill.  We think Stephen and Erik will make fantastic
  ambassadors for Team Ride to Give and we can’t wait to see them race
  for the first time with their new Hoyt Running Chair . Please help us purchase the
  Blade running chair and accessories for Stephen by making a tax
  deductible donation to Ride to Give. At this time, Stephen does not have a Facebook Page of his
    own, so follow Ride to GIve on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the
      donee organization (Ride to Give, 501c3 tax ID 46-2952297) has complete discretion and control over the use of all donated funds.

"The past month has been the most excruciating I have ever known but
  within it has been Jaspers fight for life. Each day of the first 3
  weeks had presented numerous challenges both large and small and he
  has shown thus far that he is meeting them. He is now physically stable. Jasper suffered a major seizure the evening of 2/12/16. The
  severity of which has left him with anoxic brain injury (this is
  similar to a stroke). The complexity of this condition and the
  complete unknown aspect of what lies ahead in terms of recovery is
  what is being faced at this time. Jasper has weathered the
  'neurological storms' that came upon him as a result of this injury.
  These were very severe and difficult to bear. Doctors stated that
  these ""storms"" could last days, weeks, years or never cease.
  The absolutely wonderful news is his neurological storms have subsided
  after less than a month and he has been slowly awakening from this state. He has begun to move both legs, move his eyes ( visual
  tracking) and to turn his head. Very positive steps forward. He
  responds to touch and stimuli and a few times- though not yet
  consistent-we saw a smile......it was beautiful to see! Julianne, Jasper's mom (03/29/16) What we do know is that his recovery is going to be a long
  road. He is facing years of rehabilitation, initially in a
  facility equipped to deal with rebuilding his physical  and cognitive

  looked at a room with a dozen people he couldn't distinguish who that
  person was. He's in the middle of high school now, working his first job, next
    year he'll begin driving - the world in which we live in will only
    increase in complexity without being able to see the same range of
    color. Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
    vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
    glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color accuracy. I hope someday insurance coverage for these glasses is an option.
     For now, as a single mom & full time student I created this
    campaign to ask for help.  So that anyone who wants to donate could
    help me give my son the gift he hasn't had his entire life - color

  2 when I was 16 years old with hearing and vision damaged. It causes
  tumors to grow anywhere in my brain, along with the spinal cords and
  peripheral nerves. So far I have had 20 different surgeries to safely
  remove the tumors whenever needed to preserve my life. In November 2017, I need to under go surgery again to remove multiple
  large tumors called schwannoma from both my arms. They have made my
  fingers and hands increasingly numb. If they are not carefully
  removed, they can paralyze my arms. I cannot become incapacitated, my mother will be helpless if I loose
  the ability to take care of myself. Last year, I had brain surgery at
  the US NIH, the surgery was done well. However, I was not taken cared

"“Life has a way of taking you on unexpected twists and turns that you
  did not plan or could ever imagine. So is the case with me being
  diagnosed with Sarcoidosis with advanced Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
  in 2013. A disease that until then I had never heard about. Two years,
  blood tests, numerous x-rays, an open lung biopsy, CT scans, lots of
  visits to the specialist and all kinds of medications later, reality
  finds me practically house-bound on oxygen therapy learning to adjust
  to my new normal.” -Excerpt from Rosemarie Hartnick’s Blog, https://rosemariehartnick.wordpress.com Rosemarie Hartnick is a mother of two stunning boys, Ross and Connor,
  and wife to Pastor Brian Hartnick. Anyone who knows her can attest to
  the driven, selfless, motivating person that she is. Living with
  Pulmonary fibrosis for the past 4 years has taken its toll on her
  family but she refuses to become a victim of her circumstance Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease marked by scarring of the tissue
  inside and between the air sacs in the lungs. When the scar forms, the
  tissue becomes stiff and thicker. This makes it harder for oxygen to
  pass through the walls of the air sac into the bloodstream. Once the
  lung tissue becomes scarred, the damage cannot be reversed. There is
  no cure. Many people with the disease live only about three to five
  years after diagnosis. As a friend and mentee of Rosmarie Hartnick, I am, with a few of my
  friends and family looking to help in any way that I can. The family
  is in need of a portable oxygen machine, a wheelchair, and help with
  month on month medical expenses. Rosemarie has recently undergone some
  rigorous testing at the Groote Schuur Hospital where she may undergo
  the very first double lung transplant to be carried out at the facility. Through a benefit concert, taking place on 1st October 2017,  and
  other efforts, we are looking to raise R50,000 for the Hartnick Family. We need your help to accomplish this. Would you consider donating in
  cash, kind, or time to help us achieve this mission? Please see the

"Drew Aufderheide was diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago with a rare and
  incurable form of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) .  Only 5,000 per
  year in the United States are diagnosed with this disease and because
  the cancer is caused by a chromosomal change, there is no way to cure
  it - only medication to keep it at bay.  At the age of 33, it is
  extremely rare for someone like Drew to have this form of leukemia. 
  It is normally diagnosed in people with an average age of 67, and the
  life expectancy is approximately 15 years. There are currently a lot
  of unknown facts surrounding Drew's case because physicians and
  oncologists do not often see CML in someone so young and because of
  Drew's young age, his life expectancy is unknown. What is known, is that Drew needs to take a maintenance chemo
  drug/pill each day to manage the CML for the rest of his life, or
  until a cure is discovered.  There are only a few drugs available at
  this time to treat this disease and Drew's body has already rejected
  3.  He is on the last and 4th drug that is available at this time and
  because it is so rare the demand for the drug is low.  The medication
  he is on now comes from Switzerland, the only place it is made.  The
  doctor orders it through a lab in New Jersey, it is then
  mailed directly to Drew. This medication is not available through a pharmacy. Because of the low demand, the cost for Drew's medication is
  approximately $11,000 per/month.  Medical Insurance and grants pay a
  portion of the entire cost of the drug, so Drew is faced with finding
  funding to make up the balance.  This disease has been an incredible
  financial strain on Drew and his wife Val, who have been married for
  four years. With this medication comes side effects that he must
  manage.  Drew has met this challenge with his usual strength of
  determination, peace of soul, his faith in God and warm and loving demeanor. Drew is very grateful for the prayers and financial support people
  have shown him in the past.  Financially, the importance of any
  monetary gifts cannot be overstated.  It has allowed him to pay for
  the medication to keep him alive.  From a faith viewpoint, he cannot
  thank you all enough for your prayers.  He knows from experience that
  prayer works.  During this last year when weeks of side effects have
  kept him in bed unable to work, he felt your love and prayers.","13,565",of $20k goal,https://fundrazr.com/exjqd,Drew’s leukemia fight,133,,U.S. Dollar
"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . *Notice: We are experiencing some delays with kit turnover, so
    please allow 2-3 weeks for your kit to arrive.* Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within two weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
  sample to us, the samples will be processed and analysed by the Knight
  Lab at University of California, San Diego and you will be provided
  with a list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and the
  proportions in which they are found. We estimate that this will take
  around 3 months (but possibly longer) and once we provide you with
  your results, you will be able to see how your bacterial community
  compares to others in the study. From the diet and lifestyle
  information that you provide, we will also be able to show you how
  your results compare to other people who are within the same diet and
  lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to them
  does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you have
  experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your bacterial
  profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

"DID YOU KNOW? Donny has red/green color deficiency o r
          ""colorblindness"" So while he can see most color he
          struggles to see certain colors or certain colors look

          he even sees ""real"" colors the way we do. We play
          the ""what color is this?"" game a lot. -Sometimes Don can't
          differentiate between Guacamole and Bean dip without having to
          taste it since sometimes they are the same color to him. -He gave his sister food
          poisoning once because he couldn't tell that the chicken he
          cooked was still pink. (pink tends to look grey to him) -Speaking of which, this one
          time we were playing the Slug Bug game and this light blue beetle was driving by and he
          yelled ""PINK SLUG BUG"" before punching me- he
          cheated and we haven't played that game since. -He has to change the color
          options in his video games. Bad guys = red, team
          members=green, yeah... he can't tell most of the time so he
          ends up losing a lot because he doesn't shoot the bad guy or
          he shoots his own team member. (it's actually pretty cute when
          he plays with his little brother. The little brother sometimes
          coaches him ""Shoot!"" ""Don't shoot!"")
          You'll be surprised how many video games don't give color
          alternatives for red/green -Certain shades of Purple =
          Blue or vice versa in his world. I don't think he could see
          our wedding colors properly. I'm pretty sure he agreed to the
          color because I liked it and didn't want to disappoint me. -I've caught him asking little
          kids what colors were. Not because that's an adult thing to do
          but because he truly doesn't know . -When we shop he usually asks
          me ""what color are these?"" I've rescued him many
          times from buying the worst poop-colored pants. So. Many. Times. There's a ton more stories

"Hi There! We’re a family of four that are in great need of support to help
    our youngest member Justin, recover from Lyme’s Disease, as well as
    rehab off of addictive Schizophrenic medication. In short, he was bitten by a deer tick on an eco-estate, which
    had imported deer from Germany, and he came down with all the
    symptoms of Lyme’s Disease. In South Africa where we stay, there are
    no facilities to test for Lyme’s Disease and doctors automatically
    rule that out as a diagnosis, because it’s widely believed that one
    can’t contract it here. Instead, they misdiagnosed Justin with
    Schizophrenia and placed him on a treatment that seems to have
    caused even more neurological damage in the years to follow. One of the main problems that Justin has is severe insomnia,
    which seems to have gotten way worse since he’s been on the
    anti-psychotic medication. Some of the latest research on insomnia
    suggests that the brain begins to “eat itself” after extended
    periods of sleep deprivation, which we can relate to – sometimes
    Justin is no different to someone with Alzheimer’s Disease or
    Dementia. When Justin sleeps however, the majority of his symptoms
    rapidly improves and we strongly believe with your help that we can
    find a way to reverse his condition! The Plan While spending many hours looking for ways to solve this

    protocols to help his patients heal. We believe that this doctor
    will be able to accurately diagnose and treat Justin. In addition,
    we also have found various medical centers that test genetics
    (unlike in South Africa) so that we may get an exact understanding
    of Justin’s condition. We need funds to fly to the US to receive proper diagnosis and
  treatment . We need a total of $50K to cover our basic costs
  (it may cost more depending on what the doctor says). We will need to
  stay overseas for up to six months and this funding will cover
  airfares, modest accommodation, diagnostic tests and Justin’s
  treatment for six months. We believe that Dr Klinghardt, in combination with genetic profiling
  will get to the root of the problem. You can find out more info about
  him here: http://drklinghardt.com/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKx_TMPQJsY The Full Story Every day that passes we watch Justin slip further away both
    physically and mentally … Some days are better than others … He
    suffers so much in his confused exhaustion that it’s hard to witness
    and difficult to live with. We honestly don’t know how he manages to
    continue, and so bravely, when his nightmare never seems to end. Justin’s problems began after he was misdiagnosed with
      Schizophrenia almost 4 years ago following a tick bite. The eco-estate we lived on at that time, had a private game
    reserve that included imported deer from Europe, amongst a variety
    of other game. Justin contracted his bite whilst being taken for a
    walk by our two huskies in the game park. He lost his balance and
    was dragged along for a short way. Two days later, mom spotted a
    tick on his leg and removed it. She noticed that it was unlike any
    of the species we normally see in South Africa. After searching for
    ticks on google images, we saw that it was identical to ticks that
    are found on deer in Europe and in the US; and that they are the
    ones that give people a disease called Lyme’s disease. In
      South Africa, there is no test for Lyme’s Disease, since
    it is widely believed that we don’t have ticks that transmit this
    disease in our country. In the year before, our dad died suddenly when he was
      hit by a car as he was crossing a street. We had no
    choice but to use the local government hospital to treat Justin’s
    condition, as we couldn’t afford private health care. The hospital
    staff dismissed our fears of Lyme’s disease from the start, and
    because he had been depressed and suffered from insomnia after dad’s
    death, they concluded that Justin had Schizophrenia. Initially, the
    anti-psychotic meds and benzodiazepines showed a modest improvement,
    but Justin became severely sleep deprived and was unable to sleep
    deeply or experience life normally. After a few months, a family friend donated funds so that we
    could treat Justin privately. He was taken off the hospital
    medications and slowly started to recover with a natural holistic
    program. He made steady progress in this
    time. Although he was not the same person as before, he was
    at least able to play the piano again and integrate back into being
    a part of the family. During this time, mom stopped working and his
    older brother moved back home to help us (sister and mom) care for
    him, as well as put food on the table. The medical expenses were
    exorbitant and after a year we could no longer continue with private treatment. By the end of 2015, two years after Justin’s initial tick bite, he was bitten a second time , but this time it was
    by one of our local ticks. It's usually fairly easy to recover from
    an acute bout of tick bite fever from these ticks, but in Justin’s
    case the whole nightmare we thought was behind us began all over
    again … We had to rush him intohospital and this
    time he was put on even stronger anti-psychotic medication. The
    doctors we saw (a different one every time) believed that he had
    relapsed because we had taken him off the previous prescription
    of anti-psychotic meds. In spite of the latest medication, Justin has not recovered
    since and in the last 18 months he has deteriorated rapidly. He has
    lost over 24 kilograms in the last 7 months. He sleeps a few hours
    every 4 -5 nights. He has dream states and rapid eye movements in
    mid sentence and his memory is not functional. He has become very
    childlike and needs constant supervision and input. Since
      being on the benzodiazepine medicine, he has also developed
      obsessive behaviors , like having the same conversations
    over and over, bingeing on food or pacing in continuous loops
    through the house. He is very stressed and unable to relate to
    people or even our animals, although he adored them before and used
    to spend the most time with them. The medications have not worked and we believe that they are
      making his condition worse - he has become a hollow shell of his former beautiful self.
    The hospital’s staff says that there is nothing we can do; except
    put him on even stronger medications and put him into a government
    institution. The place they recommend has a ghastly reputation and
    is like a prison for the insane - it's like giving him a living
    death sentence. Our family feels that this is outrageous – it is not
    a solution and we cannot agree to just give up on Justin, especially
    after we have already seen him nearly recovered the first time!
    Justin needs expert help that is not available in our
    under-resourced public health system. After reviewing all the
    research we could find, we believe that we need to take him
      overseas to the US to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",105,of $50k goal,https://fundrazr.com/41GoD5,Justin's Journey,3,"Nov 13, 2017",U.S. Dollar
"OUR GAME PLAN We are looking into effective alternative treatments to try to
    save Mom's life. She needs cancer-killing herbs, roots, oils, a raw
    foods diet, and we might even consider a trip to the States to a
    cancer clinic that has had a high success rate in treating people
    with cancer, plus we’re trying to get her moved back to B.C. so she can be
    near to family during this difficult time. The costs she faces are considerable, and unfortunately,
    alternative treatments aren’t recognized or covered under most
    health plans, and standard treatments also entail costs, both of
    which are looming on the horizon. Mom has grappled with health problems for years and suffers with
    pain each day, and yet in spite of this, she has reached out to help
    others heal emotionally. I’m praying that in her time of need, her friends and
    acquaintances will come to her aid. This would pave the way for her to get the treatments she needs
    to win this terrible battle she faces. ABOUT MY MOM From an early age, Mom shared a deep bond with animals. She
    traveled to the tropics and was captivated by the parrots there. In
    later years, she worked with abused parrots and rehabilitated them,
    teaching them to trust and love again. My mom has always been deeply touched by music and she is a
    talented guitarist and plays the piano. One of her favorite piano
    pieces is Clair de Lune by Debussy. She’s also an author and needs more time to finish and publish
    the books she was working on before she fell ill. She is my mother and a loving grandmother and we don't want her
    life cut short, nor have her torn away from us. One of her greatest
    wishes is to have more years to spend with us. LET’S HELP MAKE HER WISHES COME TRUE If you decide to donate to this fundraiser, any gift, whether
    large or small, will be deeply appreciated, and we thank you from
    the bottom of our hearts. Your actions may make a huge difference to
    Mom’s life and to all those who care about her and who don’t want to
    lose her.","1,450",of $20k goal,https://fundrazr.com/41FO1c,PLEASE HELP SAVE MY MOM,11,,Canadian Dollar

"Do you know Michelle, like I know Michelle? I first met Michelle
  almost 8 years ago when we were taking a course together. We became
  fast friends as we shared a love of family, food and life. Her
  positive and caring spirit along with her amazing sense of humor have
  always inspired me. She has made a career as an incredibly talented
  Stylist and has shared her passion with a great many colleagues and
  students over the past 23 years. Just over a year ago, upon returning home from a business trip to
  California, Michelle started experiencing minor symptoms of not
  feeling well and knew that something was off. There is no way any of
  us could have predicted what would follow. It turned out that Michelle
  was in Congestive Heart Failure and was taken by Air Ambulance out of
  Williams Lake so that further diagnostic tests could be performed. Her
  husband Jamie was working out in the middle of the Chilcoltin and it
  was uncertain if we would be able to contact him. By the efforts of an
  amazing friend, he was reached and given the shocking news that his
  wife was in Cardiac Failure. The results of these early test had her
  referred to much more specialized Doctors in Vancouver at St. Paul's
  Hospital. She was admitted to hospital to undergo more specialized and
  invasive tests and underwent surgery to implant a Cardiac
  Defibrillator. Immediately prior to discharge Michelle was informed
  that she would need to have a Heart Transplant and that she would need
  to be on a regimen of extensive medications and dietary restrictions
  to stabilize her heart while we waited for transplant. This was
  shocking news to say the least. Michelle had been tested from an early
  age on a regular basis because a heart condition ran in her family.
  Her older brother died of a sudden cardiac event at age 15 in 1982 and
  her Father in January of 1990. No cardiac symptoms presented in
  Michelle and by age 32 she figured that she didn't have the genetic
  defect, and like so many others, found herself without a Family
  Physician so did not undergo further cardiac testing for over a decade. Michelle has not been able to work since May of 2016 and has had to
  travel to Vancouver from Williams Lake several times over the last
  year to see the team of Transplant Doctors. With becoming a single
  income household, she is anxious as to how to pay for the upcoming
  expenses that will be incurred for Transplant, a burden she does not
  want to leave to her Husband, Jamie, to figure out. Recently Michelle and Jamie were evacuated from their home due to the
  wildfires surrounding their hometown here in BC. They spent 3 weeks
  away from home and it was while they were evacuated that Michelle got
  the news that she is now ""active"" on the Transplant list.
  This means that BC Transplant is actively looking for a Donor Heart
  match for her and that they could get the call at anytime. Michelle will have to remain in Vancouver post-surgery in order to be
  monitored for symptoms of rejection and infection. She will not be
  able to be on her own in the weeks and months immediately following
  surgery and it is anticipated that she will have to remain in
  Vancouver for up to 12 months to participate in the rehabilitation process. I have always known Michelle to be kind and thoughtful and usually is
  happiest helping others or feeding people. She has a joyful and
  generous spirit and is beloved by many but especially friends and
  family. Will you help Michelle and Jamie and alleviate the pressure of
  this monumental journey they are about to go through? Even the
  smallest donation will help. Please donate today and help this very
  special person not have to worry and be focused on her recovery.","2,290",of $30k goal,https://fundrazr.com/newheartformichelle,Please help us fund Michelle's Heart Transplant,24,"Jul 1, 2018",Canadian Dollar
"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.","1,442",of $500k goal,https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1,Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,20,,U.S. Dollar

    14. He had a great work ethic and worked not only his full time job
    but side jobs. He was a mechanic and painter a nd
    his main career was for 30+years as a Manager and District Manager
    in the Grocery field. In September 2015 his life was changed forever. As he was
    closing at his new job for the night, two armed men came in and
    robbed the store. He was beaten for over 20 minutes against the safe
    and with the handgun. Michael has had both knees operated on due to
    being slammed to the floor numerous times. He now has black out
    seizures, some are in the brain and many of the seizures are Grand
    Mal. In April of this year I came home to find him in a continual
    seizure episode. He was hospitilized and in ICU. His hospital stay
    ran for a week and I lost income due to having to stay with him. His
    diagnosis is TBI, PTSD and 80% loss of hearing on his left side (we
    are awaiting surgery on that issue); he will never be able to work
    according to his Doctors and he is unable to drive so, we have to
    pay for his rides to therapy, Doctors visits etc. Our medical bills are mounting and there has been no place to
    go for needed items. We have applied for his SSD but they are in the
    hearing stage which can be another 18 months. We have monthly
    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the
    numerous supplements that he has to take. If all bills get paid with
    this campaign, I'd also be exlploring hyperbaric treatment; studies

"Robert Seth Hayes is one of the longest held political prisoners in
  the US. After returning from the Vietnam War, Seth joined the Black
  Panther Party and was later imprisoned for his involvement in the
  struggle for Black Liberation. Seth was sentenced to 25 years to life, which means after
  serving 25 years he is eligible for parole. Seth has now been locked
  in prison for 42 years and unjustly denied parole on 10 occasions.
  Seth has a large and loving family and supportive community who yearn
  for his release. Seth turns 67 this year and suffers from multiple
  chronic medical problems. We are waging a campaign for Seth concerning his ailing health.
  With proper medical care, Seth's health issues could be under control
  but the horribly inadequate health care during his incarceration
  places him at grave risk. The combination of repetitive parole denials
  and neglectful medical care equates to a extrajudicial death sentence
  for Seth. In addition struggling to receive medical care, Seth is also
  fighting for his constitutional rights at the parole board. Seth is a
  model prisoner and meets all criteria for release, yet has been
  repetitively denied parole for no other reason than ""the serious
  nature of the original crime."" This essentially means that the
  Parole Board is taking it upon themselves to re-sentence Seth to life
  in prison without the possibility parole. Seth is challenging this
  violation of his constitutional rights with a Habeas petition. Seth needs our support. Please make a contribution to this
