## Algorithms:
* Linear Regression

## Usage

Click in the Binder bagde [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)][binder_lab] to play with the notebooks from your
browser without installing anything.

For a local installation, you will need [git], [Python], and packages from the
[Python scientific stack][scipy]. If you don't know how to install those on
your platform, we recommend to install [Miniconda], a distribution of the
[conda] package and environment manager. Please follow the below instructions
to install it and create an environment for the course.

1. Download the Python 3.x installer for Windows, macOS, or Linux from
   <https://conda.io/miniconda.html> and install with default settings. Skip
   this step if you have conda already installed (from [Miniconda] or
   [Anaconda]). Linux users may prefer to use their package manager.
   * Windows: Double-click on the `.exe` file.
   * macOS: Run `bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh` in your terminal.
   * Linux: Run `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` in your terminal.
1. Open a terminal. Windows: open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.

Every time you want to work, do the following:

1. Open a terminal. Windows: open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.
1. Start Jupyter with `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`. The command should
   open a new tab in your web browser.
1. Edit and run the notebooks from your browser.
